Welcome to the GitHub repository for my exciting Power BI project - a Sales and Cohort Analysis Dashboard!

## Data Source Description üìÇ

This Online Retail II data set contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between 01/12/2009 and 09/12/2011.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. The data comes from a CSV file with approximately 1 million rows.

## Data Modeling Process üõ†Ô∏è

I created dimension tables for customers, products, regions and time to facilitate efficient querying and visualization. By establishing relationships between these tables, we can easily navigate and analyze data across various dimensions.

## DAX Formulas üíº

DAX allowed me to calculate aggregated measures, perform cohort analysis, and generate trend analyses. Some examples:

<details>
<summary>KPI last_year_diff ‚ñ≤</summary>

---

```
% Total_Sales_diff_prev_year = 

VAR _this_year = [Total_Sales]
VAR _prev_year = 
    CALCULATE(
        [Total_Sales],
        SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_Calendar[Date])
    )
VAR _diff = _this_year - _prev_year
VAR _sign = IF(_diff>0,"‚ñ≤", "‚ñº")


RETURN

_sign & FORMAT(
    COALESCE(
        DIVIDE(_diff,_prev_year),
        0
        ),
        "#0.0%"
)
& " | "
& 
_sign & FORMAT(
    COALESCE(
        DIVIDE(_diff,1000),
        0
        ),
        "$#,##0.0K"
)
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>Customer Retention</summary>

---

-- Resurrected Customers
```
Resurrected_Customers = 
    
VAR _CustomersThisMonth = 
    VALUES(Fact_Retail[Customer ID])

VAR _CustomersLastMonth = 
    CALCULATETABLE(
        VALUES(Fact_Retail[Customer ID]),
        PREVIOUSMONTH((Dim_Calendar[Start of Month]))
    )

VAR _NewCustomers = 
    CALCULATETABLE(
        VALUES(Fact_Retail[Customer ID]),
        Fact_Retail[Months Since first Transaction] = 0
    )

VAR _ResurrectedCustomers = 
    EXCEPT(
        EXCEPT(
            _CustomersThisMonth,
            _CustomersLastMonth
        ), -- remove last month`s customers
        _NewCustomers
    ) -- remove new customers

RETURN
    COUNTROWS(_ResurrectedCustomers)
```

-- Cohort Performance

```
Cohort_Performance = 
    
    VAR _MinDate = MIN(Dim_Calendar[Start of Month])

    VAR _MaxDate = MAX(Dim_Calendar[Start of Month])

    RETURN
        CALCULATE(
            [Active_Customers],
            REMOVEFILTERS(Dim_Calendar[Start of Month]),
            RELATEDTABLE(Dim_Customers),
            Dim_Customers[First_Transaction_Month] >= _MinDate 
                && Dim_Customers[First_Transaction_Month] <= _MaxDate
        )
```
