## Data Modeling Process 🛠️

I created dimension tables for customers, products, and time to facilitate efficient querying and visualization. By establishing relationships between these tables, we can easily navigate and analyze data across various dimensions.

## DAX Formulas 💼

DAX allowed me to calculate aggregated measures, perform cohort analysis, and generate trend analyses.
